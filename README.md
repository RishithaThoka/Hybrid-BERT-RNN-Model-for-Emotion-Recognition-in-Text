# Hybrid-BERT-RNN-Model-for-Emotion-Recognition-in-Text
This project implements a hybrid BERT-RNN model for emotion recognition in text, combining the strengths of BERT for contextual understanding and a RNN with LSTM layers for sequential data processing. The model is trained on a dataset to classify text into six emotions: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise.
